# 05_LOSS_TO_FOLLOW-UP
In do-file “05_LOSS_TO_FOLLOW-UP” we classify patients LTF according to two different definitions across three time windows (90, 180, 365 days late) to create six possible scenarios. 
First, we use the WHO definition across the three different time windows. Patients more than 90, 180, or 365 days late for their next scheduled clinic appointment who did not return to care before database closure are classified as LTF on the day of their last visit, respectively.  
Second, we use another definition that classifies patients LTF the first time they have a gap in care of more than 90, 180, or 365 days, respectively. This definition can be used to assess time trends in retention ([Johnson et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25399412/)). We recommend using this definition with a time window of at least 180 days and only if transient treatment interruptions are reliably recorded. This may not be the case at all IeDEA clinics.
